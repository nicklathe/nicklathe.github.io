		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<img src="portrait.png">
		<p>I have always loved the world where technology and art intersect. From creating with Legos as a kid, to woodworking, to recoding music. It's in this world that I find my greatest joy. I'm a musician, songwriter, outdoor enthusiast, motorcyclist, beginner web developer, beer enthusiast and coffee drinker. I'm passionate about life and love learning new things.</p>
		<p>I currently work as a music and production director at a large church in the Seattle area. I oversee a team of around 30 people who all work together to make our weekly services happen.  From leading the band on stage to overseeing and directing my live audio/video team, I get to help create an experience for people using technology.</p>
		<p>I've always been interested in what goes in to developing a website. In June of this year, I decided to take the first step. I have quite a few friends who are developers, but had never dabbled with it before. I thought you had to have a computer science degree or be a math nerd. Deciding to take the dive, I started learning to code on my days off and spare evenings. I was hooked. I began with an entry level HTML and CSS tutorial on codeacademy.com and wanted more. I continued to learn via tutorials and other online resources, and ended up registering and hosting a domain name so I could have a little playground to experiment with what I was learning. I experimented with Ruby for a little while, but realized at the time I was getting ahead of myself. I wanted to animate different pieces on my site, so JavaScript and jQuery were the next step. I've spent hours reading and taking tutorials on JavaScript, and continue to enjoy it the deeper I go. While creating this page, I decided to try out some jQuery tricks. Through some trial and error, Googling and YouTube videos, I figured out how to get my page to respond how I wanted (although there are some jerky parts that I'd like to fine tune).</p>
		<p>I'm very excited about becoming a web developer and dramatically changing my career. I'm excited for the long days, the frustrating parts, and the satisfaction of overcoming these difficulties and learning new skills. I feel like I've finally found the perfect combination of technology and creativity. It's what I've been looking to do my whole life.</p>
